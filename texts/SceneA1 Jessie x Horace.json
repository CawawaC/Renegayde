I hope you’r all doin’ fine in the outland. Girls, I tell ya' I've been having a blast makin' my way through the eastern reaches. Few days ago I stumbled upon an ol' holo-theater and that's been something! The Holo that got me got me thinkin' the most was \"The infinite Lover\" by a lady called Grega E. Weird name, sure, but what a story! A hot flick about two sweet boys trying to find love, and each of their actions affecting not just their, but all the other possible dimensions. So in some worlds, they got together, and while they didn't get together in all, there still was a sort of ripple effect spreadin' love out through infinity.\n\nSure as hell, we know other dimensions exist, but what I never thought about: What if we affect them, eh? Every choice we make, every thing we do, every Mouse we squash and every Woman we shoot affects a neighborin' dimension. What a thought. Before I leave you to our evenings first song: If we all affect not just us and those around us, but those in neighborin' dimensions, we better take care and make sure we try our best, so all our possible us-es do too, and we end up in the best of possible worlds, and make every other a bit better along the way!\n\nAnd now it's my pleasure to present the beautiful and talented singster Tommy! More than a pretty face and a nice ass, this boy has got the voice of an angel too!\"\n\n//Tommys voice fills the air, singing a beautiful and haunting song about waiting for his lover to return to him.\"//\n\n[[Interesting thought.->TalkAtHoraceA0]]",
