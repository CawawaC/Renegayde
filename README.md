A visual novel project developed in Godot, made as part of the Gay Western Jam.

Jessie, a young and inexperienced cowboy in a post-post-apocalypse-genderflipped world where only women are cowgirls, sets out with his trusty friend and robotic horse Horace to visit Purple Town and make a name for himself. A story about love, friendship, flirting robot horses, multi-armed bartenders, and being yourself in the face of adversity.

A rough prototype. Sorry if you encounter any dead ends in the dialogues, we did our best.
